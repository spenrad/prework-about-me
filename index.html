      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>You've managed to find my website, congratulations! 
        Below, I will answer all the questions that you could ever
      have about me.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Sacramento, capital
         of the great state of California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my spare time I often find myself, reading, discovering new
        music and playing video games. Lately, I've been limiting my time
        outside, but have been using walks as opportunities to get in a 
        couple hours of reading. It sounds dangerous, but it helps me focus
        on reading and fits in some decent exercise.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I've always thought that if I was 6'10" being in the NBA would
        be a nice gig.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I've been a resident of the Bay Area for the past 5 years, living
        in San Francisco for the last 2 years.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I think coding and working with computers works towards my
        strongest skills. I view becomming a web developer as a
        jumping-off point to further develop my understanding of coding
        languages to get deeper into the field.
